## About
Today's competition is to launch a payload to space and return the first stage safely back to the launch pad for reuse!
## Basic Guide
1. Open map
1. Set KSP as target in Trajectory
1. Adjust re-entry params to retrograde in Trajectory

1. Open resources panel and click `Stage View`

1. Launch by hitting `Stage`
1. Go up until your speed is at **~100m/s**
1. Slowly start your turn to the east (**D key**)
1. You want to be at **~20 000m** when you separate to minimise atmospheric stress so try keep prograde above **45 degrees**
1. When liquid fuel hits **~300 units**, cut engines using `x` and stage using `space`
2. Switch to upper stage using `]`, 
3. Ignite engine by hitting `z` 
4. Set heading to the horizon
3. Switch back to first stage
4. Enable RCS thrusters using `r`
5. flip the rocket around so that it is pointing in the opposite direction you were going, should be retrograde
6. Ignite engine and switch to map view using `m`
7. when the two x's overlap cut engine using `x`, for fine grained control use `ctrl` and `shift`
8. Flip the rocket back around to point retrograde
9. Disable RCS thrusters using `r`
10. Deploy grid fins using `2`
11. Lock heading to retrograde

12. Watch your **suicide burn** counter in the top right

13. When it gets to ~0 ignite your engine
14. Feather the throttle or toggle the engine until you are on the ground
15. ???
16. Cut engine using `x` (Or run out of fuel)
17. Switch back to payload and fly to orbit using the map screen
18. Profit!

## Scoring

- `100 points` Land back on the launch pad First stage reached at least **300m/s** and **10000m** altitude 
- `70 points` Land on ground First stage reached at least **300m/s** and **13000m** altitude. Loose `3 points` for every 1 km away from **Bug-E Buggy** to a min of 40 points, rounding off.
- `40 points` Land on water First stage reached at least **300m/s** and **13000m** altitude
- `40 points` Payload reaches a stable orbit -`20 points` if the second stage is not on a suborbital trajectory and going to crash back to Kerbin - Kessler syndrome
- `50 points` Land on **Bug-E Buggy** (Stacks with land on the ground)

- `15 points` Crash land on ground, engine or guidance computer survive. Stacks.
- `7 points` Crash land on water, engine or guidance computer survive. Stacks.
